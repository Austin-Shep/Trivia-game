# Trivia-game
This project is a simple 5 question trivia game, the questions are silly and based off of the bridge crossing scene from the movie, "Monty Python and the Holy Grail". 

The true point of this project (besides a slight chortle) was to hone and refine my understanding of dynamic manipulation of the DOM, and implement multiple timers acting individually, using nothing but vanilla javascript. for this project, to increase appearence and ave time I implemented th "Animate.css" file by Daniel Eden and the "normalize.css" file for cross browser support.
